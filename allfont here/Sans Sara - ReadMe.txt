SANS SARA
A Font by S. John Ross
Cumberland Games & Diversions
www.cumberlandgames.com

This is the initial release of a font with several future releases and related fonts planned. SANS SARA is an all-new Bauhaus-styled font modeled on two things: the style Herbert Bayer, and the style, writing, and even personality of Sara King, a woman my wife and I love very much. This release, finalized and released on Sara's birthday, is a tribute to her, one of many to come. The many playful and symbolic connections between Sara King and Herbert Bayer will be documented in a special PDF to be included with later releases ... but for now suffice it to say that every detail of the font is symbolic in some way.
